Evaluation Report

1. General Information

Test Case: Example A – PackMaster-3000 (README showcase example)
Evaluation date: 2026-01
LLM model used: meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct

Prompt configuration:
- Interpretation prompt: AASia standard interpretation prompt
- JSON generation prompt: AASia standard JSON generation prompt

Execution context:
- Hardware: Intel64 Family 6 Model 170 Stepping 4 (CPU-only execution)
- GPU: Not used
- Runtime environment: Local execution

AAS schema validation:
- Result: Passed
- Validation method: Successful AASX export and inspection with AASX Package Explorer

2. Coverage of the Input Description

The generated AAS covers all explicitly stated information in the input description.
Asset identification data, technical characteristics, operational parameters, environmental limits,
pneumatic requirements, and control system details are correctly represented.

The following elements mentioned in the input text are not materialized in the generated AAS:
- Safety-related features (emergency stop circuit, protective doors monitored by safety sensors)

This omission is consistent with the current interpretation rules and prompt constraints and
does not represent an error.

3. Submodel Structure and Organization

The following submodels were detected and instantiated:
- Nameplate
- TechnicalData
- OperatingData
- MechanicalData
- CoolingSystem
- ControlSystem

Submodel classification is appropriate and semantically coherent.
Custom submodels (MechanicalData, CoolingSystem) are justified by clear grouping of related properties.
No irrelevant, redundant, or empty submodels were detected.

4. Property Representation Quality

Property naming is consistent and clear across all submodels.
No duplicated properties were detected.
No overly generic or ambiguous properties were observed.
The mapping between the interpreted structure and the generated JSON is correct and consistent.

5. Data Types (valueType) Assessment

Numeric values are correctly represented using xs:decimal.
Textual values are correctly represented using xs:string.
Decimal values are not misclassified as integers.
No incorrect valueType assignments were detected.

6. Range Representation

All explicit ranges in the input text were correctly detected.
Ranges are represented using separate minimum and maximum properties.
Range boundaries are correctly typed as numeric values.
No implicit or unstructured ranges were observed.

7. Unit Representation

Units are represented exclusively as qualifiers.
No units are embedded in numeric value fields.
Unit symbols are consistent across related properties (Hz, kW, bar, °C, packages/min).
No unit extraction failures were detected.

8. JSON Structural Quality and Schema Compliance

The generated JSON is well-formed.
The structure conforms to the IDTA AAS meta-model.
References between the Asset Administration Shell and its Submodels are correct.
Identifiers and ordering follow the constraints defined by the generation prompt.

9. Performance and Execution Metrics

Interpretation time: approximately 226 seconds
JSON generation time: approximately 592 seconds
AASX export time: approximately 0.2 seconds

Execution times are consistent with CPU-only execution and the selected LLM configuration.
Metrics are reported for descriptive and reproducibility purposes only.

10. Strengths and Limitations

Strengths:
- High coverage of the input description
- Robust handling of ranges and units
- Clear and coherent submodel structure
- Correct data type inference
- Technically valid and reusable AAS artifact

Limitations:
- Safety-related information is not represented as a dedicated submodel or properties
- Nominal throughput is represented as a string including the unit, resulting in mixed numeric/textual modeling
