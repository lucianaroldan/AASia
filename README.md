# AASia
AASIA is a lightweight no-code framework designed to run locally and operate efficiently in low-resource environments. It enables engineers and domain experts to produce standards-compliant digital representations based on the AAS metamodel. 

This repository includes a default configuration using a locally deployed instruction-tuned LLM (tested with LM Studio). The LLM backend is abstracted and can be replaced by any compatible local or API-based model.

For security reasons, API credentials for external providers are not included. Users interested in experimenting with API-based LLMs can configure the corresponding adapter by providing their own credentials.
